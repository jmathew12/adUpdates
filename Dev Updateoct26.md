Dev Update
Scrum Note
    This week, I worked on issue #29, which was solving a bug with unattending an event. Users who were already planning on attending an event were unable to change their status and not attend an event. Although temporarily on the front end it looked like unregistering was successful, when you refresh nothing changed. I have been working on the this week. This is my first time working with the backend of nsc events. It was pretty hard, but I was able to do most of the work. There is still a little bug that remains which I need to fix. Currently it does lower the attendee count, but if you are logged in as an admin or as the creator of the event, your name will stay in the attendee list until you refresh. need to make changes to that so it will also update right away.
